First of all, I want to thank my friend [Nermin ImamoviÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nermin-imamovic-aa764b129/) for their selfless support during this demo.

This is a project where we'll be using **Lambda** with **EventBridge** configured to track **EC2 instance changes**. Notifications regarding EC2 instance changes will be received in the desired **Slack** workspace and channel. This can be useful for teams working with AWS who can create a Slack channel specifically to monitor the status of EC2 instances. 

If you want to implement this demo, [here](https://srebreni3.medium.com/hands-on-integration-architecture-ec2-state-change-monitoring-via-eventbridge-lambda-and-slack-3f15b011da11) are all the steps.
